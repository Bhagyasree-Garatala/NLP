It is advertised as a healthy coffee, and I've read so much literature on it,so that was my first reason for buying it. But, now that I've been using it for 6 years, my primary reason for drinking it is the taste! I've tried other brands of mocha with the ganoderma (Reishi) mushroom, but Gano-cafe (by Gano Excel) has absolutely the best taste, and mixes the smoothest. The other brands had a tendency to be grainy and/or not mix well and settle at the bottom of the cup too much. The best ""healthy"" things I like about Gano-cafe Mocha is, of course, the benefits of the mushroom, but also the low caffiene level,which protects me from the acidity of normal coffees. It is less expensive than coffee-house drinks, and healthier, with less sugar and no chemical additives/preservatives. I, personally, use about half a package to 6 oz. of water, to tailor to my personal taste preference. Gano-cafe Mocha is my indulgence! Especially in cool/cold weather it is a tasty and comforting drink!

When they came out of the wash, 3 of the 6 bags had their designs peeling off. They looked horrid. Kind of like they were leprous or something. The other 3 bags were still fine, so I hung those out to dry while trying to figure out what to do with the 3 bags that were failing.<br /><br />I tried just peeling the rest of the design off by hand, but that was just making a mess and was taking forever. Plus, a couple areas of the design were still stuck on.  Eventually, I came up with the brilliant idea of tossing the bags back in the washer to see if a second washing, this time with hot water, would remove the rest of the design.<br /><br />Well, after trying a few different things, I ended up just tossing the 3 bags with peeling designs.

55,440477,B002ZOCEMG,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,David Bower,1,1,positive,1298246400,A Really Fine Coffee,"I'll admit I had help discovering this brand of coffee; a major consumer review magazine to which I subscribe rated it as one of the best coffees available in the USA. That got me curious so I bought some and have been buying it ever since. It has a marvelous flavor which is never bitter and has always been smooth and rich.<br /><br />The review went on to compliment its aroma and flavor and said it was simply better than the competition and at a lower price. The 100% Columbian uses an Arabica bean which I prefer.<br /><br />For the typical user the ground version is much more convenient unless you have a reasonable method of grinding the beans at home. We have a small batch grinder but it is hard to use and to clean up afterward so I usually get the ground.<br /><br />A number of local stores still carry it but you may not have one in your neighborhood. As many of us have discovered, ordering from Amazon is so easy!<br /><br />In summation, if you enjoy your coffee black this is a very successful alternative to get a great coffee taste at a better than average price.",-0.03802967070656636,-0.0003591255042518191,-0.4611712662231269,-0.3115848922154181,0.0043296577304908655,-0.09230228796704622,-0.19422562478587263,-0.44128697391165217,-0.7676104695177519,-0.5911217142435576,-0.42951407178857204,0.11841403850929677,-0.300878060938026,0.32601008418737715,0.10028721915337398,-0.32599076443385344,-0.14542905054923116,-0.044821455966646134,0.5303328201128198,0.2471133693611931,-0.173887811249534,-0.20470131888709786,-0.8627692388760325,-0.03524359244711846,0.04804012054798891,0.38771983810037514,0.368599220569548,0.6086882923989554,0.0657220410676,-0.3604468923366924,0.3787334983551304,0.2222131836738168,0.2642384012933063,0.17559851566767862,-0.39169194476581287,-0.38754261503843024,0.03328154673193733,-0.0474734875265861,-0.06884685103236202,0.09426152086756048,-0.3989964684363843,0.11210490592281225,0.7042362515541708,-0.32825447861168144,-0.03550490366801396,0.47156909965031113,-0.40058108566292755,0.14287815167161608,0.4504392951349058,-0.01226909148511784

Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.

The shipping is great...very fast and it came frozen solid. The strawberry/banana flavor is delicious. Very subtle, not too sweet and no unpleasant aftertaste. I think the chocolate is my favorite, but that's just my chocolate frenzy speaking. All of the flavors are really really good for a low calorie treat. I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around the fact that I can eat a whole pint of this for less than 150 calories. Arctic Zero will fill a serious void in my life.

Months ago I tried the three quality brown rice protein powders that are out & have found this to be the best. I been buying ever since. It's the only one that is organic, 90% Rice Protein Isolate & is dairy, lactose, soy, corn and gluten free. Compared to whey, it has a great amino acid profile. I was also looking for a higher Lysine level in comparison to Arginine which this has. Above all of this, I really love the taste and texture. It's very smooth, not chalky at all and has 24 grams of vegan protein, sweetened w/a small amt of stevia. I especially love the chocolate, blended w/almond milk, some fruit, & alittle extra stevia. I deal w/stomach problems & every other quality vegan protein powders other than brown rice, have caused me problems and I drink this every day. I couldn't tolerate the Whey or Green Pea & Brown rice ones as I experienced alot of bloating, etc. The last thing to point out is that this company offers a one pound bag where as the other companies only offer 2 pound bags and are more expensive. For me the taste of this one was the best. I just found today that Amazon is offering this brand now and at a really great price, so wanted to leave a review.",0.07124824316736371,0.3541413670649156,-0.12852929062672727,-0.2836831732430602,0.15365023307634956,0.030482752864995057,-0.19933685985567523,-0.3833521054047262,-0.6641369933565825,-0.5619380986192308,-0.5239044470970168,0.2323666990100621,-0.14249724370771993,0.4847188916356155,-0.27416000437427274,-0.3839170630318202,0.11205743345216247,0.02579654614960426,0.7272687907396205,0.08557608480543244,-0.15492720581936453,-0.013677938383285619,-0.7308751278591791,0.3697976652545348,-0.08371751692474635,0.3721245391125106,0.0923417144700199,0.49206678918290214,-0.5234430127570872,-0.12148536927840892,0.4753085144867413,-0.039235127143429686,0.24609097594609913,-0.08003370059642578,-0.41297981403740575,-0.2956461109150721,0.2716579237132598,-0.13637676559460077,-0.22918577026385886,0.16568038585801564,-0.3415159951844563,0.08132215535108238,0.7642287077165654,-0.43986558783774016,0.17002039096592822,0.49363269961431494,-0.3178985383574173,0.0374843262107321,0.19794349852279355,-0.32379279529764854

(they've been on back order for a LONG time). She said that she didn't care for Brazil nuts either but that she loved this. Well, after sitting on my counter for 2 weeks thinking that I wouldn't like them, I finally tried them. She was right. These really ARE tasty. However, at over $6 per bag, I won't be purchasing from this particular seller. In fact, it was my understanding that Amazon required competitive pricing? Maybe I'm wrong.

Nothing is stuck together and it reminds me of instant potato flakes.  When you add water to it, you will smell it in the next room, it smells like freshed cooked meat loaf.<br /><br />I have been home preparing my dog's food for almost 10 years now and havn't really found a premix my dogs liked.  But let me tell you, the minute I added warm water to this and mixed it into their meat mix, they smelled it and were waiting to eat it up.<br /><br />I have a female American Eskimo that is very picky about her food and a male EskiePom that has a sensitive tummy.  Both dogs licked their bowls clean and neither had any tummy issues or loose stools.  That was 3 weeks ago and they are still cleaning their bowls.<br /><br />I am excited to try more products, because if they are anything like this one, I will be thrilled!<br /><br />Thank you Grandma Lucy for making a great product!",-0.13535827163962147,0.22923992326078138,-0.6528010855302132,-0.12972742200922902,0.07528431995334377,0.29289688795902025,-0.09521154681005363,-0.2567955375089333,-0.9061616418244058,-0.10716488034257393,-0.48399504416310224,0.08544637241020715,-0.4388884195677628,0.2762492527955541,0.046333985300313386,-0.31172015014905546,-0.12740955813117288,0.5390711674549638,0.515254597496048,0.19167293657015838,-0.035428797404673924,0.11376372963153904,-0.9615923363560106,-0.05447514089613559,0.22928980062966312,0.21683986685070197,0.4042341071934519,0.48022879380744693,0.24214040897386307,-0.2478697664203488,0.04193993539812541,0.4075902514975766,0.46083600702678895,0.016393555138696305,-0.5884843464058016,-0.44779568384766943,0.2758310582437295,0.07372075995648332,-0.10500106394922007,0.08322743900127844,-0.2626331536855229,0.14504561874471855,0.6490551884026816,-0.2758100563997394,-0.0822161717623553,0.47575586244232154,-0.22646740345340063,0.024467102299190475,-0.1716197268610303,-0.26093300210790477

121,36602,B004CLCEDE,A3GUX9OSWFJHOO,Michael R Burke,0,1,positive,1314748800,Fishy and satisfying,"So I bought these for my wife because she is into fitness and had heard about these noodles from people she works out with. Apparently they are zero calorie fillers and make it easier when cutting to lower your carb intake. When she opened the bag, there was a definite hint of fishiness. I was skeptical that they would be good, but she cooked them up and added a decent sauce and I couldn't really taste anything awry. I can't really say they are good or bad tasting, because they pretty much take on the flavor of whatever you eat them with. They were pretty satisfying and made me feel full for quite a while. I guess they are just fiber. Overall, I find them to be a bit expensive as a means of taking in zero calories. If I want to do that in the future I will just eat less. If I were a weaker person, however, that needs to feel full all the time, these might be a great solution.",-0.018563808409764484,0.09225349444156733,-0.23055609079700945,-0.07154924474933146,0.37996190505058464,0.2831270475355535,-0.17790097424631163,-0.22393485257236778,-0.8078413268294392,0.07231051735295069,-0.5719540553725128,-0.0450588356866055,-0.47359653213717273,0.30866367373965264,0.08036844334208074,0.023250537024456064,-0.03496897940539522,0.4944244278847644,0.4842570170235857,0.009155183063028115,0.20086105753770211,0.11258076920384663,-1.4556036735345828,0.14751162224141234,0.5992739369531184,0.06358633385849313,0.119018704614911,0.39322551977231274,0.5076629050257158,-0.43009689143703367,0.29250066951389925,0.264356897803713,0.20921353664485212,0.108988276312008,-0.6831086528999921,-0.5512131152459588,0.6046103971773682,0.002618745761163156,-0.43996044875101625,0.3293520026126734,-0.02472075100514556,0.18112621860572717,0.5608188832009745,-0.23464781812852936,-0.1640954324518097,0.48125123662115715,-0.12490613452834713,0.11489449025539737,-0.031147160421496824,-0.5083448593263475

I am normally just a plain old soap kind of guy. I don't really care much for anything too smelly, and the body washes I have tried (received as a gift or used in a resort) have left me feeling that I would never want to try a body wash. Either I got hives (yes, that happened with H20 brand), or it just left a film. Well, Dove Men + Care is a different story. It smells good, not just nice, but really good....and my wife likes it, too, she said, ""It has a manly smell."" I'm not sure what that means, but it was said in a positive way, so that's good with me. It also rinses off easily, and my skin did actually feel softer without feeling filmy. As for the ""smell,"" it's a crisp aroma, not musky and not woodsy. If you can imagine what ""clean"" ice would smell like (if there were such a thing), that is as close as I can get. It is not an overpowering aroma at all. Lastly, the container is perfect. It stands upside down very nicely and allows gravity to keep it at the dispensing end, which is great. As for value, well, I believe there is some value here. Each of these are fairly large, and should last for a while, so for the price, you are getting quite a lot.

I learned about the new Betty Crocker mixes right at the beginning of June before they were available, and kept checking in the grocery stores around here to see if they had them. I found them at Price Chopper last Friday and made them today, and the batter tastes like regular batter, even though it's a lot thicker. Once I baked them, the whole house smelled like chocolate, which didn't happen with the other mix. They taste SO good. They're really chocolatey, and a little bit chewy and are just like regular brownies. The Amazon price is a deal - I paid $4.49 at the store, and I would pay that much again, but with the Amazon price SO much lower... I'd rather buy them here.

145,171513,B0001CXRL6,AW8RIOVE67GZ,Lloyd De Jongh,5,5,positive,1284076800,"Healthy, flavourful, smooth teas","Having tried tried many brands and varieties of Yerba Mate over the last 3 years, I have developed a strong liking for the Guayaki brand after 2 years of enjoyment of their product. They are a quality brand producing fine Mate.<br /><br />I don't find the Guayaki Mate quite as strong as other brands, having less of that Mate kick, however I do find the smooth, rich flavours very satisfying. I have several different ones in my kitchen right now - they're good for 2 to 3 cups a day. Their Mate drinks are similar to the Aviva brand in the range of flavours, however Guayaki is clearly a superior brand. Between Taragui and Guayaki brand Mate, I am hooked on this drink for its uplifting, positive effect on my health and well-being.<br /><br />I am a native of South Africa, the home of Rooibos (Red Bush) tea - and while I enjoy it, this Mate has a more profound effect. And tastes a darn sight better than Green Tea.<br /><br />The appeal of this and the other flavours will depend on your own taste preferences, however I enjoy them all and recommend the product whole-heartedly. It's got a permanent place in my kitchen, my work bag and car, with me wherever I happen to be.",-0.033731178156231396,0.2050882480172637,-0.13231532837441534,-0.432672260184735,0.3517348290038179,0.04153903785874493,-0.08458195970731884,-0.5326217110293886,-0.4696211401085803,-0.4928120677958886,-0.3083295542053751,0.17532984585492542,-0.4437170224158491,0.19252686181037768,-0.27767227842149106,-0.19516344160873678,-0.004091934863577548,0.1167505515647226,0.3690330471211384,0.026070372045664546,-0.10435200099645892,0.07266790450961923,-0.5993888233715368,0.045600602432759534,-0.038980831012192574,0.39180430069426697,0.28835208841862653,0.7789844298439504,-0.2021243743257298,-0.2940149171432096,0.5000554806281362,-0.005976204903311697,0.32512680482921946,0.043137030536859765,-0.036401817708924714,-0.2649888252061109,-0.05226912315278858,-0.11578771489097699,0.013504219053706227,-0.05628418322262911,-0.2741692736555751,0.13161418026461563,0.61579642583453,-0.4630923520237811,0.06476501295551361,0.32036473766509604,-0.08310652353731178,-0.26313652732405474,0.049998518438229125,0.09467154154984367

I don't know what it is about the idea of peanut flavoring in a tea ... it just doesn't sound right to me.  I am all for just about any other type of nut (yeah, I know that peanuts aren't technically nuts), but, peanuts just sounded too weird to me.  Then I tried Peanut Taffy and this changed my whole idea of how good peanut flavor can taste.<br /><br />So, I got the courage and I ordered this Matcha, and I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's really quite good.  Much better than I expected it to be.  It is good prepared traditionally, with water and whisked well, but then after taking my first sip, I decided I wanted to find out what a pinch of salt might add to the flavor.  And so I added a tiny pinch of sea salt and I LOVE this.  It is really yummy!<br /><br />Smooth, rich and creamy.  Nice peanut flavor, balanced well with the fresh, leafy green taste of the Matcha.

I made the switch to Puroast coffee.  And I love it!  Yummy, yummy stuff and I'm proud to say my health has greatly improved.  Any drawbacks?  Absolutely.  It's way too expensive and the pre-ground coffee is very fine (like espresso) and choked up the coffee machine every time when I first started using it, leading to coffee grounds floating around in my coffee cup.  The simple solution?  Brewing six cups at a time instead of eight - works like a charm.

They pride themselves on the history of the product. I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.<br />I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.<br />What a waste of my hard-earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is.<br />Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again.

Although most dogs like these treats (and they are a good price for the amount you get), please use caution.  Smokehouse, a chinese exporter, was involved in the massive contaminated treat and food recalls last year.<br /><br />If you can't afford the healthier and safer free range treats (such as lamb ears, kneecaps, tendons, etc), you can instead find some great recipes to make your own dog snacks.  Or buy a Kong and shove some doggie snacks in it, or smear a dab of natural peanut butter in it... it will keep your dog busy and is good brain stimulation.<br /><br />If you absolutely must buy these Smokehouse treats, be sure to CHECK THE CONTAINER FOR BUGS.  The last one I saw had some of the most disgusting gray beetle-looking bugs crawling into and around the treats in the jar.

This is my new source for chocolate extract!  I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Regarding this seller, I had an issue with the shipping (as at least one of the bottles broke during shipment), so this seller promptly re-sent the broken bottles at no additional charge.  I am very satisfied with this seller, and I highly recommend them, too!<br /><br />Don't think that I'm all sunny, either.

This is my review I think it is not as sweet as some of the other reviews here says it is. But it is thicker than the oil and has a consistency like frosting. Mostly it is good to use as a spread like the almond butter.<br /><br />I wouldn't refridgerate it though it can be frozen like it says in the description. The pack gave me a choice of the almond butter which is good and tasty but not as sweet as I would like. If I can figure out how to put this in a cheesecake I will that would be a nice added ingredient.

But even though they are big my 7 lb girl goes for the whole thing to bite it although 1/2 goes on the floor but she cleans that up.  She is a 2 year old I just got 2 months ago and the vet said her teeth had plague build up so I'm hoping these help, she's not the type to let me brush her teeth, although I have wanted to buy those dental wipes to use along with these.  My girl has a small mouth and she handles these so I think if the cat likes them enough they will bite through to get the benefit.  Ultimately it would be better if they were a little smaller, and I also give her some greenies so I hope it helps.",0.016549867508886134,0.08096984347740775,-0.46457735860367727,-0.4021590691908048,0.6593548584811468,0.4173369668182376,0.04732818273319196,-0.3703922634286619,-0.48202455335752,0.02664242987264052,-0.5768976023331237,0.09861580347788824,-0.48691356563010724,0.3562481108209771,-0.05081764596421322,-0.09830599810868218,-0.2370583438443065,0.5468093522675392,0.608992842930683,-0.0664164547565256,0.015941859461191425,0.06729124510103536,-1.324711258545478,0.3311151889343652,0.26313710878630614,0.1786917004029172,0.20412785701772046,0.432224305079634,0.565179057948669,-0.17050456538326597,0.05669142989186958,0.257725965821469,0.10416481359728431,-0.09057070100323256,-0.42382659652652155,-0.5742709634002912,0.7174943734104051,0.10654984041181834,-0.49123939328981064,0.24820862167970512,0.13270430467564923,0.3814313099011896,0.5904065728660315,-0.16090960525610823,-0.4010576418611905,0.7136731455432503,-0.168685036435719,0.26861616415779477,-0.35364027296882183,-0.5927422415425139

More than just ginger and honey I think.","I am a real fan of ginger and honey. I drink a lot of Republic Of Tea's versions, plus I love those real ginger - ginger ales, the kind that almost burn your throat and you can feel it going all the way down!  Well, Kili's instant beverage is not quite what I'm used to and that is fine, but I did not care for it. As I say, I've had lots of ginger and ginger/honey drinks, but this had some kind of odd flavor to it.<br /><br />First impression, the drink was not a tea, not in a bag etc. When you open the single serving pouch, there are dark granuals inside that you just dump into a  cup. It says to add water but in MLs so I was lucky to fing out my Pyrex measuring cup had MLs on there. I added hot water and stirred it. The color in my cup was pretty dark brown, a lot darker than my teas etc. The scent was okay, not bad. But the flavor, at a very small sip, was super strong. I don't think watering it down would really help either. Also, the ginger aspect was pretty sweet and reminded me of candied ginger, (which I love) but that other flavor, I don't know what it was..was distracting.<br /><br />Personally I would not drink this again and did not try it cold. That might be better but the flavor really put me off. I did like the convenience that the sweetener was already in there, that it was granuals so no teabag to mess with.",0.07725301166011421,0.28475498230719537,-0.5205725873682338,-0.24029372797211482,-0.09938862905329264,-0.2653450559686592,-0.6121186878519945,-0.5733664635083803,-0.7847138586517359,-0.2956506394270691,-0.5417082163530262,-0.14081352885158435,-0.5836566102984819,0.3202354611730475,-0.3155102325862858,-0.19741162620315672,0.28110501845156394,0.2450990330303336,0.5569677099737326,0.18747659440081021,-0.24260730523162735,0.15941313947932143,-1.1993333492219234,0.10186794587982055,0.07324227348263665,0.2680702989429197,0.016822232687404372,0.317124127882862,0.03185614681335471,-0.26217707294205783,0.3388409641173989,0.2819334730898393,0.8296740853264783,0.22029642491736245,-0.578947258734427,-0.21843658199771604,0.15229469358842765,-0.10997793227364029,-0.1098952326120027,0.00597040635413868,-0.17271626254907382,0.10208512025178781,0.8558067622618563,-0.3376518712522895,0.007965403401402142,0.22318916875650222,-0.22927749932185706,0.1617038601669359,0.3488785688202703,-0.13839287109824774

It took me a try or two to figure out what time worked best, but since my ""microwave button"" never worked to begin with, I was already used to taking the extra ten seconds to do it myself.  For my microwave, 2:22 works perfectly.  It pops almost every kernel and doesn't burn a single piece.<br /><br />I've noticed that with these pop-up bags, the butter seems to be more evenly distributed, and the popcorn has a less dry consistency, so I'm a HUGE fan of that!  I also love that I don't have to make the choice between getting a bowl dirty or getting my hands buttery anymore.  It takes a time or two to get used to tearing the top off the popup bowl, but once you get it it's pretty darn easy.  Just do it SLOWLY to make sure you don't rip the bag.  It may be a pain to get it off, but you have to realize that if it wasn't attached so securely, it would come apart in the microwave.

I had four of them on the kitchen cabinet when she made one of her unannounced and unwanted visits.  With out asking, she grabbed one, ate it and loved it.  I was tempted to stop her, but let her finish off the other three.  The dogs looked at her rather oddly as they are a bit brighter than she is.

I have heard ""That's the best steak"" or ""That's the tastiest chicken, I have ever had"" mor than 100 times from family and friends since I found this spice some 15 or so years ago. Back then however, I only had to purchase one bottle at a time at ANY of the major food shopping markets in my neighborhood. It was always right there in the ""Spice Islands Rack"" with all the other fine Spice Islands products. Then one day it was like ""Old Hickory Smoked Salt"" had been discontinued and was impossible to find any longer, meanwhile all the same huge assortment of spices were still available at the same shopping centers.Since that day, I have had to order this product online, purchase 3 bottles at a time, and pay a ridculous ammount of shipping fees to get this product to my famlies table. Why was this product discontinued in markets in the first place ???? Why must I have to purchase online only Spice Islands ?? Seems to me, a product this good, should be within arms distance , in every store, to every customer, in the great ol' United States of America !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It turned out to be fair.<br /><br />If you use the recommended serving size, you'll find you don't taste is AT ALL.  Nada.  Zip.<br /><br />If you use three times the recommended serving, you'll find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar, and I do mean subtle.  You'll have to hunt for the flavor.  Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.<br /><br />It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor.  You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.<br /><br />Oh well.  The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.<br /><br />That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit.
